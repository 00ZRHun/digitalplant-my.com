										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a constant battle for marketers to understand how they can better engage with their audience on social media. A good engagement takes more than just creating good content. It is important to, first, understand the roles of different social media platforms, as each platform has its own purpose, and sets of users. Once you have well understood the use of different platforms, the type of users engaged in it, the next step is to build a relationship with your audience through your contents.</p>
<h2>Why is social media engagement important for your business?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-873 aligncenter" src="https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/number-of-users-social-media-platforms.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="412" srcset="https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/number-of-users-social-media-platforms.jpg 699w, https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/number-of-users-social-media-platforms-300x177.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Figure 1. </i><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Number of social network users worldwide from 2010 to 2023</i></a><i> by  Statista (2020)</i></p>
<p>Based on the statistics above, more and more people are getting onto the social media bandwagon. According to the analysis done by <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-global-digital-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kepios</a>, as of 2020, there are more than 3.8 billion social media users worldwide, representing 49% of the world’s total population. Based on the statistics by Statista 2020, Facebook has about 2.45 billion monthly active users, 2 billion on YouTube, 1 billion on Instagram, 675 million on LinkedIn and 340 million on Twitter.</p>
<p>The numbers on the data shows how important it is for companies to leverage live engagement on social media platforms as part of their marketing strategies. It is time for marketers to identify the most popular social media platforms that are relevant to your business, as it will help you to maximize your brand reach, as well as helping you to engage with the right people.</p>
<h2>Optimize user engagement on social media</h2>
<h3>Tips #1: Prioritize authentic content</h3>
<p>Authentic content is about honesty. It helps a brand and their targeted audience to be able to relate and understand one another. It is important for user engagement because it represents you, your brand and your company. Having authentic content shows a high level of credibility and it shows that you are an expert in your field, which is an effective way to market to your prospective customers. Not to mention that authentic and personalized content helps you refine your audience focus by targeting people who are more likely to engage with your content as it informs the readers about a particular need that they have, which directly places your brands in the top spot of their purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>To create authentic contents, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Find your voice</b>: Be consistent in your writing. Find the right tone that best represents you and your company and stick to it.</li>
<li><b>Identify your target audience</b>: Narrow down your audience and focus on feeding them with relevant and insightful information. Find out what their interests are and what they will likely respond to.</li>
<li><b>Engage with your audience</b>: Always remember to interact with your audience. For instance, thank them for their feedback, reply to their inquiry and remember to sound more human. An honest interaction will make the conversation more memorable and increase your brand authenticity.</li>
<li><b>Believe in your content</b>: The key to write authentic content is to write based on your experience and knowledge so trust yourself and trust your expertise.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips #2: Put emphasis on video</h3>
<p>From transportation to lifestyle industry, you can see that video has been widely used as a means of marketing. Creating a video content is very effective these days and its popularity is in line with the rise of social media. Therefore, it does not matter what industry your business is in, or what type of business you are, video marketing provides marketers with an interesting, up-to-date and highly shareable content to reach their targeted audiences.</p>
<p>The big question is, can video really increase your engagement? According to the survey done by Wyzowl on <a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video marketing statistics 2020</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“87% of video marketers say video has increased traffic to their website”</li>
<li>“95% of video marketers say video has helped increase user understanding of their product or service”</li>
<li>“80% of video marketers say video has directly helped increase sales”</li>
</ul>
<p>Video in general is entertaining, but the main reason why video marketing is becoming more desirable for businesses is because it helps to deliver a message in a more effective manner within a shorter amount of time. The visual and audio aspect of it also help the audience to better understand the message that the marketer is trying to deliver. However, it is also important to remember that your video contents need to meet your audiences’ expectations, by reflecting your products or services that your audiences are interested in.</p>
<h3>Tips #3: Focus on micro or nano influencer</h3>
<p>Is influencer marketing still “a thing”? The short answer to that is yes. But as important it is to identify who your audience is, finding the right influencer to represent your brand, is very important as well. Influencer marketing is basically collaborating with an influencer to market a certain product or services in order to improve brand recognition. Nano influencers, is part of an <a href="https://mediakix.com/influencer-marketing-resources/influencer-tiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">influencer tiers</a>, which refers to influencers with between 1,000 to 10,000 followers on their social media.</p>
<p>Collaborating with nano influencers is highly beneficial because:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Higher engagement rate</b>: Due to the smaller number of followers compared to other influencers that are higher in the influencer tiers, nano influencers are able to have a stronger connection with their followers. As stated by the <a href="https://hypeauditor.com/blog/the-state-of-influencer-marketing-2019-five-key-takeaways-to-remember/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of Influencer Marketing 2019 report</a>, the engagement rate of mega influencers (more than one million followers) is 1.97%, while the rate for nano influencers is 5.60%. Since nano influencers tend to have better personal relationships with their followers, the interactions between both sides are very active.</li>
<li><b>Authentic endorsement</b>: Nano influencers tend to have a strong influence within a niche community. Which is why the brands or services that the nano influencers represent are deemed to be more authentic due to their ability to connect and relate with their followers day-to-day lives. Once a follower is able to relate with a nano influencer, it makes them more relatable and approachable. This genuine interaction is a great opportunity to build relationships and nurture trust, not just between the nano influencers and the followers, but also with the brands.</li>
<li><b>Cost-effective: </b>Nano influencers do not rely on influencer marketing as their main source of income, and they are not considered as “professional influencers”. Since they are not approached by a lot of brands, most nano-influencers agree to promote a product or services for a nominal fee and even in exchange for a product. According to a survey done by <a href="https://socialpubli.com/blog/i-microinfluencers-study-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SocialPubli</a>, only 44% of nano influencers prefer monetary compensations, while the rest are happy with just a gifted collaboration.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emailing has long been used as an important channel to connect with the customers, even before the booming of digital marketing. However, as technology advances, more platforms have emerged online and provided marketers with a wider range of choices. When digital marketing is mentioned, are “Facebook, YouTube, Google Ads” always the first keywords that come into your mind? Does it mean that email has lost the digital game even before it starts? Is email still relevant amidst the digital saturation? If your answers are negative, you might have to think twice. Here’s why:</p>
<p>1. Cost-effectiveness<br />
When it comes to marketing, the most important question would always be “Could this strategy bring good revenue to our business?” With email marketing, the answer is almost guaranteed “yes”. Recent research by the Direct Marketing Association shows that email marketing is able to generate $38 in ROI for every $1 spent. Powerful enough? It’s even more powerful when it’s compared to the popular social media. In terms of acquiring new customers, email is proven to be 40 times more effective compared to Facebook and Twitter, according to the McKinsey report. It’s also worth mentioning that email marketing requires very minimum to almost no cost.</p>
<p>2. Wide reach<br />
We all know that almost everyone online has one or more email addresses. Indeed, there is no doubt that new channels like social media have rapidly occupied our daily lives. However, the fundamental of a social media account is still an email address. In other words, everyone is approachable via email. To be more precise, more than half the population around the globe uses email, and 91% of them actually do check their email at least once a day, as mentioned in the Entrepreneur magazine. Besides, email remains the most preferred communication channel, as Optinmonster reports that 58% of users would first check their email in the morning compared to any other activities on their phones.</p>
<p>3. Personalized content<br />
Unlike other marketing tactics, email marketing is highly customizable as marketers have full control over it. We have full ownership of every single detail of the email, from crafting the content to deciding the best sending time. We often hear that “content is king”, but this is not merely a myth as it would determine how the customers would respond to your business. Customers love personalized messages, and always tend to react towards it. Imagine when you are looking for a new house, you receive an email from a property agent, would you open and click on it? The answer is definite. Email provides us with the versatility to talk to our customers with a more personal touch based on their profile and needs.</p>
<p>4. Measurable in real-time<br />
The success of a marketing tactic is never known if there is no way to measure it. Numbers are essential when it comes to measuring the success of a campaign. With the use of marketing tools, the performance like open rate and click-through rate is immediately reported after the emails are delivered. It means a lot to the marketers, as we could make necessary adjustments on our next step within a short time.</p>
<p>5. Tactics integration<br />
The versatility of email marketing has been discussed above. Should this mean that email is the opponent of the other channels? The truth is no. It’s normal for businesses nowadays to connect with their customers in multiple touchpoints, including website, social media, or even physical events. The question is “how could we let our customers know about these?” Emailing could help to tie all these campaigns together into a single communication. We could send our customers an e-newsletter to keep them updated and engaged. Besides, embedded “call-to-action” buttons in newsletters entice customers to engage.</p>
<p>The market reactivity has proven how relevant exactly email marketing is to your business. The impact of email marketing has often been underestimated. In fact, the value that it could create is larger than we thought. With all the great things mentioned above, it is fair that email marketing should be seen as the pillar of your digital marketing strategy among all other channels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In this first instalment of a series of four articles, we will share some tips about B-to-C and B-to-B Digital Marketing Campaigns.</em></p>
<p>We all know that a good marketing email campaign is the first step to create loyalty from your existing customers and to convert new leads into sales.</p>
<p>However, this exercise is extremely time-consuming. From the draft of a template, the content creation (text, image or videos…), targeting, integration and routing, the entire process can take up several days. And needless to say that the more entities involved (web developer, creative studio, activation team etc…) the more time you will spend and waste before you can even think of deploying your campaign.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this takes a toll on your KPIs, and could also affect the performance and morale of your team.</p>
<h2><strong>So how could you save time without losing content quality?</strong></h2>
<p>The answer is very simple, yet tricky to implement properly. AU-TO-MA-TION. It consists of automating your campaigns via specific software like Adobe Campaign, Pardot, Eloqua or Marketo.</p>
<p>First, you will have to define your targets according to different <em>personae</em> (the profiles of your customers, their needs, their issues). Once these profiles are defined, you will have to create several email templates or landing pages depending on the situations (invitation, newsletter, promotion, email confirmation, etc.) will be the skeleton of your campaign. The basic material in short. Your teams will add the content they want, such as text, images, links.</p>
<p>Since the software is linked to your database, your teams will set the targeting filters (NAF code, company size, prospect maturity, etc.) independently. The essential interest of this tool is that it will allow you to trace and analyze the behaviour of your prospects in a very detailed way.</p>
<p>Reading area, click rate, A / B test, consultation of other media (website, white paper …); you will collect essential data to identify the maturity of your prospects and to “score” them ie. to evaluate their level of maturity with an index represented by a number and a letter, A1 being a “warm” prospect compliant to your target (business, company size) with a strong interest (e.g. he has visited your website several times and/or has downloaded multiple media) and D4 is a cold prospect that has neither interest, nor the profile of a potential customer, so very little to no intention of purchasing your products. For more details, read this <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAA/Help/LeadScoring/LeadScoring.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">article</a> that explains the scoring matrix used by <strong>Oracle’s Eloqua</strong> tool.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the real added value of this type of practice?</strong></h2>
<p>The main advantage of marketing automation lies in the information it will provide to your web marketing team but also to your sales representatives. Once your database of “warm” prospects has been identified, your sales teams (field, telesales, customer service) will be able to take advantage of these highly qualified contacts for their prospects.</p>
<p>This is the lead generation.</p>
<p>Finally, you will benefit from premium performance indicators for your ROI reports.</p>
<p>Maybe you use Google Analytics? Already complete in terms of KPI, it is surpassed by this software that will provide you with detailed reports on prospects behaviour.</p>
<p>In summary, refining your marketing strategy, getting to know your prospects better, generating qualified leads, saving time and giving your teams more freedom are some of the many benefits of marketing automation. Need some guidance regarding marketing automation?</p>
