										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the exponential utilization of technologies that capture data (the Internet of Things, social media, web cookies, etc.), managing data has become a major priority for businesses regardless of their size.</p>
<p>Indeed, companies collect, store and analyze large volumes of customer data daily. They have the possibility as well to purchase databases or sell theirs to third parties. In general, customer data can be acquired by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking customers (forms, customer account details, etc.)</li>
<li>Tracking (social media, keywords researched, etc.)</li>
<li>Adding databases from other sources</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why should you collect data?</h2>
<p>First, data helps you learn more about your customers / your audience: You can learn what exactly is luring your customers in and why they are choosing the product. Based on this, you can improve their customer experience. For instance, A/B testing works well to evaluate which call to action, visual, offer, etc. has the best impact for your customers.</p>
<p>Data management is useful to discern trends in their behaviours as well. Furthermore, this knowledge will support to segment your audience into several customer groups. From there, you can target each group through refined digital marketing strategies adapted to their behaviour.  This way, you can reduce inefficiencies and maybe unveil potential sources of revenue.</p>
<p>In addition, segmentation is helpful to narrow down the optimal price range, according to the price tolerance, behaviour and demand of each group. Combined with past transactions and market research, you will have the necessary information to determine ideal pricing to maximize sales without lowering your margins or customer perception.</p>
<p>Moreover, data collected can give you valuable feedback to enhance your product or service quality in order to better meet your customers’ needs.</p>
<p>Overall, data gives you insights facilitating and supporting business decisions.</p>
<p>Additionally, for some businesses, data is a mean to secure more sensitive data: particularly in the banking industry, voice, facial or fingerprint recognition serve to authorize a user’s to access their financial information (that enables them to lower fraud risk).</p>
<h2>It’s not that simple though, is it?</h2>
<p>It is easy to comprehend what all the rage is about but before being insights, customer data is raw data that needs to be sorted, structured and analyzed. Think of it as the difference between petrol and fuel. Your vehicle can only put into service the later to move forward. Raw data can add up to a large daily volume that no human could read fast enough to impact a business. According to Lucidworks (search technology), most companies only analyze around 10 % of the data collected. The unknown and unexploited data is known as dark data:</p>
<p>“The information assets organizations collect, process and store during regular business activities, but generally fail to use for other purposes (for example, analytics, business relationships and direct monetizing).” (Source: Gartner)</p>
<p>Dark data includes data that companies captured but are unsure how to exploit, but also data they are unsure or unaware they actually collected.</p>
<h2>So how can you turn raw data into actionable business decisions?</h2>
<p>As stated before, the amount of data to go through is large and collected daily, so it is humanly extremely difficult to sort and analyze quickly enough. Thankfully, we have machines and computers in particular that operate even during non-business hours (and do not take smoking breaks J).</p>
<p>Going further than statistical models, data analysis methods like machine learning or deep learning (and artificial intelligence in general) are powerful allies to break down the large volume of data into actionable insight. Some artificial intelligence programs go as far as offering recommendations.</p>
<p>Navigating through all the collected data may be overwhelming at first, but luckily, there are some ready-made tools that you can operate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Intelligence tools</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A business intelligence (BI) software is designed to analyze via automated processes the exponential volume of business data in order to provide a better understanding of an organization’s strengths and weaknesses. They can include reporting, dashboards, online analytics processing, real-time analysis, cloud BI, data mining and predictive analytics, etc.</p>
<p>Mostly, all BI software are data visualization tools. They present data in a way that is easy to understand and use for decision-makers. Humans are visually driven by nature. Data visualization tools enable them to get real-time business-critical information, in an overview. Visualization (either with widgets, KPIs, charts, tables, or more commonly a mix of these) present information in defined spaces with different shape, colour and size to provide context and meaning. In a glance, thanks to BI technology, the decision-maker can identify trends and insights.</p>
<p>Data visualization is ideal to persuade as well. A chart or graph has a higher level of impact than simply displaying a table.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Relationship Management tools</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool is designed to enable businesses to establish long-term relationships with prospects and customers via personalized, meaningful interactions. The idea is that a business’ success is related to the relationship it builds with its customers.</p>
<p>CRM tools track customer interactions (and their history with the business) and service issues, store contact information and manage marketing campaigns. All that data is visible and accessible in one platform.</p>
<p>Some of the main business benefits of CRM are enhancing customer retention and customer satisfaction, boost sales and conversion rate, reduce lead costs. Furthermore, according to RingLead, 74% of CRM software users believe the tool enhanced their access to customer data.</p>
<p>Indeed, CRM tools display on one-page key information regarding potential leads from various channels and interactions with the prospect/customer (through emails, calls, social media, website, etc.). In that way, and provided the CRM database is accurately updated, this kind of software will support enlightened business decision-making.</p>
<h2>Don’t forget to stay compliant with regulations!</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, managing data has become a major priority for businesses. Because it has, and because consumers are wary of the amount of data collected about them by so many organizations, governments build frameworks of regulations.</p>
<p>These regulations define data protection principles you must comply with when processing personal (including customers’) data.</p>
<p>Here are a few that could be interesting to look into:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – European Union</li>
<li>Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) – Malaysia</li>
<li>Privacy Act – Australia</li>
</ul>
<p>Does your business have a high ratio of dark data? Are you looking into optimizing data management in your organization? Or simply stay compliant to the regulation?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The hunt for data is on. In order to position themselves adequately in the Digital Revolution, companies think, eat and drink Big Data. But what about Small Data? Does the smaller brother have no use anymore?</em> Do gigabytes of information have irremediably relegated a smaller, immediately usable and scalable intelligence to obsolescence? Understanding data and how it influences business strategy is a straight-up necessity in today’s world, and chances are the modus operandi related to gathering, analyzing and exploiting data is quite blurry. Big data is a common topic of discussion but when was the last time you thought about big data’s little sibling, small data?</p>
<h2><strong>What is the small data? And how does it compare to big data?</strong></h2>
<p>Small data is everywhere. In fact, everyone generates small data: each time we log into social media, use search engines or click on ads. Social media alone offers considerable insight regarding buyer decisions and customer lifecycle, based on small data sets. Small data is data small enough (in terms of volume, format &amp; velocity) for human comprehension. Depending on your company’s size and objectives, big may not always be relevant: it could mean very detailed statistics, daily transactions collected, as well as machine data. It can amount to data that is interrelated, complex and difficult to assimilate.</p>
<p>We can consider big data as raw data in this sense. It is information your business can use, but it requires some polishing first and the amount of information itself makes it difficult. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use big data; it simply means you’ll need to organize it properly before you can turn it into something more valuable. If big data is complex, does that make small data easier to tackle? In a sense, yes. It is slightly easier to comprehend and can be straightforwardly translated as valuable insights. From another angle, working with small data requires relevant tools and a data-oriented mindset.</p>
<h2><strong>The benefits of using small data</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>Martin Lindstrom, author of the book ‘Small Data,’ writes, <em>“Small data is the foundation for breakthrough ideas or completely new ways to turnaround brands.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Small data immediately translates into business intelligence. The distance between small data to using it to reach more audience that is relevant, is short: small data, by nature, is easily comprehensible by humans. It is actionable. This means you can use small data to benefit your business almost immediately. More businesses are using small data. In the age of digital transformation, data-driven marketing decisions are more and more valuable to companies. Using small data can enable them to stay ahead regarding their business and marketing strategies. Big data remains important, but combining both can be the first step to reach consumers in a meaningful way. Consumers are on board, too. Even though they might not realize it, customers value small data as well. Whether they want the lowest price on plane tickets home for Christmas or enjoy the ease of personalised shopping experience from their favourite store, the people your organization wish to target are already involved in marketing initiatives based on small data.</p>
<p>Small data focuses on the end-user. It’s no secret that focusing on this area is one of the best ways to understand what they want and need from your business. Small data is closer to the end user and focuses on an individual’s experience with your company. In that way, small data helps to achieve a consumer-centric approach. Small data is simple data. Translating big data into small data makes it more comprehensible for decision makers. Big data, because of its complexity, requires expert interpretation while small data does not have this issue. This means small data can help your company reach its audience by helping stakeholders understand how to turn that data into a real strategy.</p>
<h2><strong>After downsizing, what to do?</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-609 size-full" src="https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/small-is-big-article.jpg" alt="Small is Big &gt; Featured Image" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/small-is-big-article.jpg 1024w, https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/small-is-big-article-300x200.jpg 300w, https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/small-is-big-article-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Small data serves as the foundation necessary to implement big data efforts into business plans, so a core understanding of small data is key before moving onto using big data. Small data enables companies to acquire a more detailed view of their business and how consumers interact with it. Smaller data sets are more accessible to less data-savvy individuals who may not be prepared to analyze larger data sets. Your business already collects tons of small data sets. The tools used by your business teams (media monitoring, CRM or analytics platforms) aggregate information to enable easy review. If, for example, you want to produce customer profiles to identify key audiences for your market, you could export your CRM database. Depending on the company size and the state of its database, this export could focus only on a sample size of the customer database. Review the profiles of your current customers and prospects to understand key pieces of information about them.</p>
<p>Analyzing and gathering information identifies trends that emerge from your existing customers and provides insight on key demographics you should be targeting with your communications campaigns. Although confusing at the outset, data, like any other communications measurement tactic, provides deeper insight about business and communications decisions, allowing for better, data-driven decision-making. We, at Digital Plant, can assist you in optimizing your small data in order to create more sales leads. Our expertise also includes digital campaigns (emailing, SEO, SEA, SMO), content &amp; design. For more information, find us on our website: <a href="https://digitalplant-my.com/en/">www.digitalplant-my.com</a>.</p>
