										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Content marketing</strong></h2>
<p><strong>According to the Adobe and E-consultancy report</strong><strong>, creating appealing content is second (after the customer experience optimization) in the list of digital trends presenting the most interesting opportunities for business in 2019 (15% in B2B and 13% in B2C). However, what is content creation? What’s the purpose? And where does the word “content marketing” come from? Let’s take a closer look at this article.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What is content marketing?</strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Content marketing is a strategy that consists in creating appealing content to: put yourself on the map, attract prospects, boost your visibility (on social media or Google for instance), increase your audience or generate qualified leads.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is the starting point of content marketing?</strong></h2>
<p>This concept comes straight from the United States (the “cradle” of modern marketing): Benjamin Franklin published in 1732 his <em>Almanac du Bonhomme Richard</em> to promote his printing company.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yet, John Deere was the first to use content marketing to increase the sales of green tractors for his company: the Deere Company.</span></p>
<p>In 1895, he published the first edition of <em>The Furrow</em> for farmers: the magazine included agricultural or economical advice to improve their yield. Today, the magazine releases more than 1.5 million copies in more than 40 countries.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-618 size-full" src="https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tractor-marketing-practice-233x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The cover of The Furrow and its green tractors.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In France: in 1900, Michelin published its famous Guide giving advice to drivers regarding the maintenance of their vehicle, but also travelling (lodging, restaurants recommendations). The rest is history.</span></p>
<p>Last, the term “<em>Content Marketing”,</em> first used by Penton Media in 2001, gradually replaced the less sexy “Custom Publishing”.</p>
<h2><strong>What types of content for content marketing?</strong></h2>
<p>In 2020, content marketing is increasingly visual. After all, according to a <a class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HubSpot report</a>, for 32% of marketers visuals are the most relevant content for their business.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brands storm platforms like Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube or Tik Tok (for the youngest), communicating via photos, videos, computer graphics, GIF, filters, etc.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coca-Cola, for instance, launched a Snapchat filter for Christmas 2016 to reach the millennials audience; Tropico used an Instagram campaign this year to promote its rebranding.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Augmented reality (AR) is also interesting to optimize the user experience and reinforce a purchase decision. For example, Ikea offered its customers to visualize how furniture or objects would look in their homes via the AR View feature of the Amazon app.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-620 size-full" src="https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/new-marketing-practice-image2-300x169-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Amazon App feature for Ikea: the Augmented Reality View</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Videos are also widely used by B2C companies to attract and retain customers, through either a makeup tutorial on YouTube or a story on Instagram for a brand selling glasses. However, they can be also interesting in B2B with a more educational approach such as webinars.</p>
<p>In this sector, editorial content is more relevant than graphic content for professionals. It has a double advantage: asserting the reputation and expertise of a company, and enhancing its website search engine optimization as well, the algorithm of Google being fond of this quality content. The many tweets, blogs, newsletters, articles, white papers and others are sources of good practices for the professionals who follow them as part of their market watch.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s the difference between inbound and content marketing?</strong></h2>
<p>Inbound marketing is a global marketing strategy aimed at attracting customers to their service or product.</p>
<p>While inbound and content marketing share a common goal of converting leads through quality content, content marketing is just one of the many inbound marketing techniques like marketing automation or lead nurturing.</p>
<p>To sum up, content marketing (more than two centuries old already) still has good days to come. Increasingly visual, it is constantly adapting to the target audience and new technologies to attract curious consumers or experts. In 2019, its efficiency is well established.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The hunt for data is on. In order to position themselves adequately in the Digital Revolution, companies think, eat and drink Big Data. But what about Small Data? Does the smaller brother have no use anymore?</em> Do gigabytes of information have irremediably relegated a smaller, immediately usable and scalable intelligence to obsolescence? Understanding data and how it influences business strategy is a straight-up necessity in today’s world, and chances are the modus operandi related to gathering, analyzing and exploiting data is quite blurry. Big data is a common topic of discussion but when was the last time you thought about big data’s little sibling, small data?</p>
<h2><strong>What is the small data? And how does it compare to big data?</strong></h2>
<p>Small data is everywhere. In fact, everyone generates small data: each time we log into social media, use search engines or click on ads. Social media alone offers considerable insight regarding buyer decisions and customer lifecycle, based on small data sets. Small data is data small enough (in terms of volume, format &amp; velocity) for human comprehension. Depending on your company’s size and objectives, big may not always be relevant: it could mean very detailed statistics, daily transactions collected, as well as machine data. It can amount to data that is interrelated, complex and difficult to assimilate.</p>
<p>We can consider big data as raw data in this sense. It is information your business can use, but it requires some polishing first and the amount of information itself makes it difficult. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use big data; it simply means you’ll need to organize it properly before you can turn it into something more valuable. If big data is complex, does that make small data easier to tackle? In a sense, yes. It is slightly easier to comprehend and can be straightforwardly translated as valuable insights. From another angle, working with small data requires relevant tools and a data-oriented mindset.</p>
<h2><strong>The benefits of using small data</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>Martin Lindstrom, author of the book ‘Small Data,’ writes, <em>“Small data is the foundation for breakthrough ideas or completely new ways to turnaround brands.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Small data immediately translates into business intelligence. The distance between small data to using it to reach more audience that is relevant, is short: small data, by nature, is easily comprehensible by humans. It is actionable. This means you can use small data to benefit your business almost immediately. More businesses are using small data. In the age of digital transformation, data-driven marketing decisions are more and more valuable to companies. Using small data can enable them to stay ahead regarding their business and marketing strategies. Big data remains important, but combining both can be the first step to reach consumers in a meaningful way. Consumers are on board, too. Even though they might not realize it, customers value small data as well. Whether they want the lowest price on plane tickets home for Christmas or enjoy the ease of personalised shopping experience from their favourite store, the people your organization wish to target are already involved in marketing initiatives based on small data.</p>
<p>Small data focuses on the end-user. It’s no secret that focusing on this area is one of the best ways to understand what they want and need from your business. Small data is closer to the end user and focuses on an individual’s experience with your company. In that way, small data helps to achieve a consumer-centric approach. Small data is simple data. Translating big data into small data makes it more comprehensible for decision makers. Big data, because of its complexity, requires expert interpretation while small data does not have this issue. This means small data can help your company reach its audience by helping stakeholders understand how to turn that data into a real strategy.</p>
<h2><strong>After downsizing, what to do?</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-609 size-full" src="https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/small-is-big-article.jpg" alt="Small is Big &gt; Featured Image" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/small-is-big-article.jpg 1024w, https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/small-is-big-article-300x200.jpg 300w, https://digitalplant-my.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/small-is-big-article-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Small data serves as the foundation necessary to implement big data efforts into business plans, so a core understanding of small data is key before moving onto using big data. Small data enables companies to acquire a more detailed view of their business and how consumers interact with it. Smaller data sets are more accessible to less data-savvy individuals who may not be prepared to analyze larger data sets. Your business already collects tons of small data sets. The tools used by your business teams (media monitoring, CRM or analytics platforms) aggregate information to enable easy review. If, for example, you want to produce customer profiles to identify key audiences for your market, you could export your CRM database. Depending on the company size and the state of its database, this export could focus only on a sample size of the customer database. Review the profiles of your current customers and prospects to understand key pieces of information about them.</p>
<p>Analyzing and gathering information identifies trends that emerge from your existing customers and provides insight on key demographics you should be targeting with your communications campaigns. Although confusing at the outset, data, like any other communications measurement tactic, provides deeper insight about business and communications decisions, allowing for better, data-driven decision-making. We, at Digital Plant, can assist you in optimizing your small data in order to create more sales leads. Our expertise also includes digital campaigns (emailing, SEO, SEA, SMO), content &amp; design. For more information, find us on our website: <a href="https://digitalplant-my.com/en/">www.digitalplant-my.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In this first instalment of a series of four articles, we will share some tips about B-to-C and B-to-B Digital Marketing Campaigns.</em></p>
<p>We all know that a good marketing email campaign is the first step to create loyalty from your existing customers and to convert new leads into sales.</p>
<p>However, this exercise is extremely time-consuming. From the draft of a template, the content creation (text, image or videos…), targeting, integration and routing, the entire process can take up several days. And needless to say that the more entities involved (web developer, creative studio, activation team etc…) the more time you will spend and waste before you can even think of deploying your campaign.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this takes a toll on your KPIs, and could also affect the performance and morale of your team.</p>
<h2><strong>So how could you save time without losing content quality?</strong></h2>
<p>The answer is very simple, yet tricky to implement properly. AU-TO-MA-TION. It consists of automating your campaigns via specific software like Adobe Campaign, Pardot, Eloqua or Marketo.</p>
<p>First, you will have to define your targets according to different <em>personae</em> (the profiles of your customers, their needs, their issues). Once these profiles are defined, you will have to create several email templates or landing pages depending on the situations (invitation, newsletter, promotion, email confirmation, etc.) will be the skeleton of your campaign. The basic material in short. Your teams will add the content they want, such as text, images, links.</p>
<p>Since the software is linked to your database, your teams will set the targeting filters (NAF code, company size, prospect maturity, etc.) independently. The essential interest of this tool is that it will allow you to trace and analyze the behaviour of your prospects in a very detailed way.</p>
<p>Reading area, click rate, A / B test, consultation of other media (website, white paper …); you will collect essential data to identify the maturity of your prospects and to “score” them ie. to evaluate their level of maturity with an index represented by a number and a letter, A1 being a “warm” prospect compliant to your target (business, company size) with a strong interest (e.g. he has visited your website several times and/or has downloaded multiple media) and D4 is a cold prospect that has neither interest, nor the profile of a potential customer, so very little to no intention of purchasing your products. For more details, read this <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAA/Help/LeadScoring/LeadScoring.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">article</a> that explains the scoring matrix used by <strong>Oracle’s Eloqua</strong> tool.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the real added value of this type of practice?</strong></h2>
<p>The main advantage of marketing automation lies in the information it will provide to your web marketing team but also to your sales representatives. Once your database of “warm” prospects has been identified, your sales teams (field, telesales, customer service) will be able to take advantage of these highly qualified contacts for their prospects.</p>
<p>This is the lead generation.</p>
<p>Finally, you will benefit from premium performance indicators for your ROI reports.</p>
<p>Maybe you use Google Analytics? Already complete in terms of KPI, it is surpassed by this software that will provide you with detailed reports on prospects behaviour.</p>
<p>In summary, refining your marketing strategy, getting to know your prospects better, generating qualified leads, saving time and giving your teams more freedom are some of the many benefits of marketing automation. Need some guidance regarding marketing automation?</p>
